They either offered similar functionality or attempted to solve the same problems in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these products was acquired by GitHub recently, since I can’t compete with the platform it made me come back to the drawing board and think how else I can provide value with the data and analytics I’ve already gathered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the initial goals on DevLytics was showing you, the developers, how you perform in a repository, where you can improve and how. Going forward, this will be the bigger focus of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
