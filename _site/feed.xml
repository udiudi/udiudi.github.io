&lt;p&gt;In the near future we’ll allow you to see more personalized metrics, and see how certain events and changes in your team affect your performance and workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the latest changes to open-source accounts include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Showing the latest repositories we analyzed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allowing to compare performances to other repos in the same category. Not as a competition, but to draw motivation and ideas to do things differently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Badges for GitHub’s README page to showoff your response times and merge rate ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

They either offered similar functionality or attempted to solve the same problems in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these products was acquired by GitHub recently, since I can’t compete with the platform it made me come back to the drawing board and think how else I can provide value with the data and analytics I’ve already gathered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the initial goals on DevLytics was showing you, the developers, how you perform in a repository, where you can improve and how. Going forward, this will be the bigger focus of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
