title: What's Next for DevLytics.io?

When I first thought about DevLytics, there were already similar products and few other in the works. They either offered similar functionality or attempted to solve the same problems in different ways.

One of these products was acquired by GitHub recently, since I can't compete with the platform it made me come back to the drawing board and think how else I can provide value with the data and analytics I've already gathered.

One of the initial goals on DevLytics was showing you, the developers, how you perform in a repository, where you can improve and how. Going forward, this will be the bigger focus of the product.
