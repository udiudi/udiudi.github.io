It's been a long journey for me working on DevLytics mostly on my own since 2018. What started as a repository automation and team performance tool became a great source for project clarity, pain points, team performance and a worthy sidekick to team leads to see the big picture - both on the human and technical side.

Over time, more and more of the features on DevLytics were offered by the platform its build upon, which makes competition extremely difficult and keeping it afloat can't be justified financially, not to mention the ability to attract new premium users is declining. 

Permium users with private repositories can export their data, and should do so before December 31st 2020. 

It's been a great ride! and I'm not done creating new a useful tools for people.
