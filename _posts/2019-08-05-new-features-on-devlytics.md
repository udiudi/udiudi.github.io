title: New Features on DevLytics

I'm still not done with DevLytics, and there are [several new things](/whats-next-for-devlyticsio/) I want to achieve. 

Some of the latest changes to open-source accounts include:
- Showing the latest repositories we analyzed.
- Allowing to compare performances to other repos in the same category. Not as a competition, but to draw motivation and ideas to do things differently.
- Badges for GitHub's README page to showoff your response times and merge rate ;)

Cheers!
