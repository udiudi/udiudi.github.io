I've been coding since a young age and got to experience a variety of tech stacks and companies of different sizes and culture.

I've worked as a freelancer with local and remote companies, I lead the technology front in several companies (some of whom were acquired) and I was an early employee in few startups and created the infrastructure and workflows which the R&D department and the system were built upon. 

I'm well versed in several tech-stacks, faced big technological and people challenges, passionate for efficiency, team-scaling and building a great product.

My latest professional history is described [here](/small.cv.pdf).
