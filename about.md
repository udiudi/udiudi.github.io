Hi, I'm Udi.

I've been coding since a young age and got to experience a variety of tech stacks, companies of different sizes and culture.

Throughout my career I've worked with local and remote teams, lead the technology side of several comapnies (some of them were acquired), created the infrastructure and workflows which the R&D department and the system were built upon.

I'm well versed in several tech-stacks, faced big technological and people challenges, passionate for efficiency, team-scaling and building a great product.

**I'm looking for new opportunities** in a form of contract work, being hired by a great company, or creating one from scratch.
